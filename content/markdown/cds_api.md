The `CDS Application Program Interface (CDS API)` is a Python library which allows you to access data from the ADS `programmatically`. The library is available for both Python versions, Python 2.7.x and Python 3, but we recommend to use the library under Python 3. In order to use the CDS API, follow the steps below:

* [Self-register](https://ads.atmosphere.copernicus.eu/#!/home) at the ADS registration page (if you do not have an account yet)
* [Login](https://ads.atmosphere.copernicus.eu/user/login) to the ADS portal and go to the [api-how-to page](https://ads.atmosphere.copernicus.eu/api-how-to)
* Copy the CDS API key displayed in the black terminal window in a file under `$HOME/.cdsapirc`

**Note:** You find your CDS API key displayed in the black terminal box under the section `Install the CDS API key`. If you do not see a URL or key appear in the black terminal box, please refresh your browser tab.
